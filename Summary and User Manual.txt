Summary

This shiny Application is inspired by the Regression Models Course project we worked on.
Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, we are interested in exploring the relationship between 
a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome).

In this project, I focussed on answering two main questions:

1- Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG
   
2- Quantifying how different is the MPG between automatic and manual transmissions?
